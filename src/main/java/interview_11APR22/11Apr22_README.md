Three problems were asked and I totally froze on retrieving bits out of an 
integer.

* Problem 1: Given an integer n, return if bits k1 and k2 are the same.
* Problem 2: Remove the vowels from some input string.
* Problem 3: Determine if a valid path from start to end exists in some address mapping.
