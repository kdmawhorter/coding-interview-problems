# Technical Interview Problems
This project serves to allow myself some space to practice algorithm questions 
as well as record my work for posterity. I will also rework the actual interview 
questions I get just to prove to myself that I do in fact know how to code
even when I freeze up on the digital whiteboard :). Interviews are listed by 
date to ensure anonymity of the source.
